      <div class="collapsible-header"><i class="material-icons">keyboard_arrow_right</i>Does a score greater than 16 mean that I will have chronic pain 7-10 years from now?</div>
      <div class="collapsible-body"><span>A score above 16 means that you might have chronic pain in the next 7-10 years. If you do not currently have chronic pain, developing chronic pain can be prevented with treatment. If you currently have chronic pain, continuing to have chronic pain is preventable with treatment. Keep in mind that our prediction is not perfect. Check this table for your chance of actually having chronic pain in 7-10 years given your FUTUREPAIN score.</span></div>

    <li>
      <div class="collapsible-header"><i class="material-icons">keyboard_arrow_right</i>If I have a score greater than 16, can I avoid developing chronic pain? </div>
      <div class="collapsible-body"><span>Yes. You can likely prevent chronic pain without drugs or surgery. If the survey says you have high risk for chronic pain, you will receive an email invite to join the FUTUREPAIN Intervention Study. The study uses research-based interventions to prevent chronic pain. Everyone in the study will get the treatment to prevent chronic pain at some point. </span></div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <div class="collapsible-header"><i class="material-icons">keyboard_arrow_right</i>What if I already have chronic pain? Does a score above 16 mean my pain will never go away? </div>
      <div class="collapsible-body"><span>No. For many people, a simple treatment can reduce or even stop chronic pain within a few months drugs or surgery. If the survey says you have high risk for chronic pain, you will receive an email invite to join the FUTUREPAIN Intervention Study. The study uses research-based interventions to prevent chronic pain. Everyone in the study will get the treatment to prevent chronic pain at some point.</span></div>

If you do not currently have chronic pain, developing chronic pain can be prevented with treatment. If you currently have chronic pain, continuing to have chronic pain is preventable with treatment.
